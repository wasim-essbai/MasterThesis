\section{Alterations}

In this case study,the alterations to apply have been identified by considering common perturbations that could occur during image acquisition. It is important to note that the networks used in this study are designed for research purposes and are not intended for a specific application, therefore a precise domain analysis was not possible to perform. The alterations employed are inspired by the work of Arcaini et al. \cite{9176802}. Six different alteration types are identified, which will be presented in this section.
